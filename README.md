Due to an issue with Github Pages not rendering the ipywidget elements in the html conversion of the Jupiter Notebook, the following links can be used to view the project within your browser. 

External links to html versions of the Jupiter Notebook:

* [Output Only](https://shanemcbryde-atriskstudents.on.drv.tw/html/Predicting-Academic-Performance-Output-Only.html)
* [Output With Code](https://shanemcbryde-atriskstudents.on.drv.tw/html/Predicting-Academic-Performance-With-Code.html)

As well, Chrome sometimes has an issue accessing these links, while Firefox and Edge have had no such problems. Weird stuff!
